## Overview
I am thrilled to share my successful experience working on the Wisabi Bank ATM Transaction Data Analytics Project. The purpose of this project was to analyze the ATM transaction data for Wisabi Bank, gaining valuable insights into customer behavior, ATM usage, and identifying opportunities to enhance the bank's services. Throughout the project, I conducted data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization using Excel/Power BI.

During this project, I collaborated with various stakeholders, including Wisabi Bank Management, the ATM Operations Manager, Branch Managers, Data Analysts, and the IT Department. Together, we ensured the project's success and made data-driven decisions to improve customer experience and optimize operations.

5. Explored the impact of public holidays and weekends on ATM usage and transaction patterns.
6. Investigated the frequency and amounts of transfers between accounts and different banks.
7. Evaluated the performance of each ATM location, considering uptime, maintenance issues, and customer satisfaction.
